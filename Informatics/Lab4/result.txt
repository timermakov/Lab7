Dramatis Personae Claudius, King of Denmark.
Queen of Denmark, mother to Hamlet.
And I am sick at heart.
What we two nights have seen.
Looks it not like the King?
By heaven I charge thee speak!
Tis gone and will not answer.
Is it not like the King?
Who is't that can inform me?
At least, the whisper goes so.
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
You told us of some suit.
That it should come to this!
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
I'll change that name with you.
My lord, the King your father.
For God's love let me hear!
These hands are not more like.
Did you not speak to it?
My lord, from head to foot.
Then saw you not his face?
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
It would have much amaz'd you.
Your loves, as mine to you.
Till then sit still, my soul.
But let me hear from you.
Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
And recks not his own rede.
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
My blessing season this in thee!
What I have said to you.
Ophelia, he hath said to you?
Ay, fashion you may call it.
You must not take for fire.
What does this mean, my lord?
That I will speak to thee.
Why, what should be the fear?
Being a thing immortal as itself?
To what issue wail this come?
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.
To ears of flesh and blood.
Wouldst thou not stir in this.
Denmark But he's an arrant knave.
In faith, My lord, not I.
Nor I, my lord- in faith.
We have sworn, my lord, already.
The time is out of joint.
My lord, I did intend it.
Marry, well said, very well said.
My lord, that would dishonour him.
That he is open to incontinency.
What was I about to say?
Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
And let him ply his music.
But truly I do fear it.
That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some Attendants].
The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
That do I long to hear.
Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
Answer, and think upon this business.
Came this from Hamlet to her?
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
How may we try it further?
But keep a farm and carters.
Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.
How does my good Lord Hamlet?
He said I was a fishmonger.
He is far gone, far gone!
What do you read, my lord?
What is the matter, my lord?
How pregnant sometimes his replies are!
Good lads, how do ye both?
Nor the soles of her shoe?
In the secret parts of Fortune?
But your news is not true.
Let me question more in particular.
Denmark being one o' th' worst.
To me it is a prison.
Tis too narrow for your mind.
What should we say, my lord?
My lord, we were sent for.
King and Queen moult no feather.
Do the boys carry it away?
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore.
Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
The which he loved passing well.
You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.
What, my young lady and mistress?
One speech in't I chiefly lov'd.
As low as to the fiends!
Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.
Polonius and Players [except the First].
Dost thou hear me, old friend?
Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
That he should weep for her?
As deep as to the lungs?
I'll tent him to the quick.
This night to play before him.
To hear and see the matter.
And lose the name of action.
As made the things more rich.
Go thy ways to a nunnery.
O, help him, you sweet heavens!
Go to, I'll no more on't!
Hamlet and three of the Players.
King hear this piece of work?
Here, sweet lord, at your service.
As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
Why should the poor be flatter'd?
To sound what stop she please.
They are coming to the play.
I'll have a suit of sables.
King dead, and makes passionate action.
The dead body is carried away.
We shall know by this fellow.
You are naught, you are naught!
Unite comutual in most sacred bands.
In neither aught, or in extremity.
If she should break it now!
Sleep rock thy brain, [He] sleeps.
Madam, how like you this play?
O, but she'll keep her word.
What do you call the play?
So you must take your husbands.
Pours the poison in his ears.
Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
No, my lord; rather with choler.
Will you play upon this pipe?
It is as easy as lying.
Look you, these are the stops.
Methinks it is like a weasel.
It is back'd like a weasel.
To wash it white as snow?
Look you lay home to him.
Pray you be round with him.
I'll warrant you; fear me not.
No, by the rood, not so!
And (would it were not so!
Come, come, and sit you down.
Ay, lady, it was my word.
Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
In noise so rude against me?
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
To serve in such a difference.
And melt in her own fire.
As will not leave their tinct.
O, speak to me no more!
And put it in his pocket!
Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
How is it with you, lady?
Look you how pale he glares!
To whom do you speak this?
And break your own neck down.
What thou hast said to me.
And blow them at the moon.
This man shall set me packing.
Then] Exit Hamlet, tugging in Polonius.
Even on the pith of life.
He weeps for what is done.
And bear it to the chapel.
King's countenance, his rewards, his authorities.
King is not with the body.
The King is a thing- Guil.
How now O What hath befall'n?
Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern [with Attendants].
What dost thou mean by this?
He will stay till you come.
That else leans on th' affair.
Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.
Good sir, whose powers are these?
How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
Poland, sir, Or for some frontier?
Be but to sleep and feed?
Examples gross as earth exhort me.
Her mood will needs be pitied.
Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
Charity, Alack, and fie for shame!
By Cock, they are to blame.
How long hath she been thus?
That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
Laertes, Why thou art thus incens'd.
They shall go far with little.
As day does to your eye.
Till our scale turn the beam.
Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
O, how the wheel becomes it!
There's fennel for you, and columbines.
And will he not come again?
And will he not come again?
Do you see this, O God?
Guildenstern hold their course for England.
He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.
Break not your sleeps for that.
Are all the rest come back?
As how should it be so?
That I might be the organ.
What out of this, my lord?
May fit us to our shape.
If this did blast in proof.
But stay, what noise, Enter Queen.
Let shame say what it will.
But that this folly douts it.
Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
How dost thou understand the Scripture?
I'll put another question to thee.
Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.
For such a guest is meet.
Not a jot more, my lord.
Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
For such a guest is meet.
Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing.
Must there no more be done?
And not have strew'd thy grave.
This is I, Hamlet the Dane.
What wilt thou do for her?
For love of God, forbear him!
Swounds, show me what thou't do.
Dost thou come here to whine?
I'll rant as well as thou.
That would not let me sleep.
My head should be struck off.
Th' effect of what I wrote?
Does by their own insinuation grow.
To quit him with this arm?
Sir, this is the matter- Ham.
The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
Queen and all are coming down.
Laertes before you fall to play.
Nay, good my lord - Ham.
King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.
His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
Give them the foils, young Osric.
Cousin Hamlet, You know the wager?
These foils have all a length?
Now the King drinks to Hamlet.
He's fat, and scant of breath.
Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
Come, let me wipe thy face.
You make a wanton of me.
Look to the Queen there, ho!
She sounds to see them bleed.
The King, the King's to blame.
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
Heaven make thee free of it!
March afar off, and shot within.
Why does the drum come hither?
What is it you will see?
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
Where should We have our thanks?
All this can I Truly deliver.
